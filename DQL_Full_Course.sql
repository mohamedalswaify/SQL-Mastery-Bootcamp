------------------------------------------------------------
-- üìò THEORETICAL INTRODUCTION: What is DQL?
------------------------------------------------------------
-- DQL (Data Query Language) is used to fetch data from database objects such as tables and views.
-- The main DQL command is:
--     SELECT

-- üîπ SQL SELECT SYNTAX:
-- SELECT column1, column2, ...
-- FROM table_name
-- [WHERE condition]
-- [GROUP BY column1, column2, ...]
-- [HAVING group_condition]
-- [ORDER BY column1, column2, ... [ASC|DESC]]

-- üîπ Operators:
--   ‚ûï Arithmetic: +, -, *, /
--   üîÅ Comparison: =, !=, <>, <, <=, >, >=
--   üß† Logical: AND, OR, NOT
--   üßÆ Range: BETWEEN ... AND ...
--   üìã List: IN (...)
--   üîç Pattern: LIKE 'pattern'
--   üö´ NULL Check: IS NULL, IS NOT NULL

-- üîπ Functions:
--   üî§ Text: UPPER(), LOWER(), LEN(), LEFT(), RIGHT()
--   üî¢ Numbers: ROUND(), CEILING(), FLOOR()
--   üìÖ Dates: GETDATE(), DATEADD(), DATEDIFF(), YEAR(), MONTH(), DAY()
--   üîÑ Conversion: CAST(), CONVERT()
--   ‚öôÔ∏è Conditional: CASE, IIF()

-- üß† This course demonstrates how to use SELECT in practical contexts, from basic retrieval to advanced logic and multi-table operations.
------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------
-- üî∞ BEGINNER LEVEL: Basic SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY
------------------------------------------------------------

-- Task 1: Retrieve all employee data
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Task 2: Select specific columns
SELECT last_name, hire_date, job_id, salary, department_id FROM employees;

-- Task 3: Calculate annual salary
SELECT last_name, salary * 12 AS annual_salary FROM employees;

-- Task 4: String concatenation
SELECT first_name + ' ' + last_name AS full_name FROM employees;

-- Task 5: DISTINCT and FILTERING
SELECT DISTINCT department_id FROM employees;
SELECT last_name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary < 2500;
SELECT last_name, job_id FROM employees WHERE job_id = 'IT_PROG';

-- Task 6: Use BETWEEN, IN, and LIKE
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2007-12-31';
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (30, 60, 90);
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE job_id LIKE '%MAN';
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE last_name LIKE 'A%';

-- Task 7: NULL and NOT NULL
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE commission_pct IS NOT NULL;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE commission_pct IS NULL;

-- Task 8: ORDER BY
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY last_name;
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Task 9: Aliases and expressions in ORDER BY
SELECT last_name, salary * 12 AS annual_salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary * 12 DESC;

------------------------------------------------------------
-- üü° INTERMEDIATE LEVEL: Variables, GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE
------------------------------------------------------------

-- Task 10: Parameterized query
DECLARE @job NVARCHAR(20) = 'IT_PROG';
SELECT last_name, job_id FROM employees WHERE job_id = @job;

-- Task 11: BETWEEN with variables
DECLARE @low_sal INT = 5000;
DECLARE @high_sal INT = 8000;
SELECT last_name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN @low_sal AND @high_sal;

-- Task 12: Text functions
SELECT UPPER(last_name), LOWER(job_id), LEN(last_name) FROM employees;

-- Task 13: GROUP BY
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS emp_count FROM employees GROUP BY department_id;

-- Task 14: HAVING
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department_id HAVING AVG(salary) > 6000;

-- Task 15: CASE for custom columns
SELECT first_name, salary,
    CASE 
        WHEN salary >= 10000 THEN 'High'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 5000 AND 9999 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS salary_level
FROM employees;

-- Task 16: Date functions
SELECT first_name, hire_date, GETDATE() AS today, DATEDIFF(DAY, hire_date, GETDATE()) AS days_worked, YEAR(hire_date) AS hire_year
FROM employees;

-- Task 17: CAST and CONVERT
SELECT salary, CAST(salary AS VARCHAR) AS salary_text, CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), hire_date, 103) AS formatted_hire_date
FROM employees;

-- Task 18: IIF
SELECT first_name, salary, IIF(salary >= 10000, 'Top', 'Normal') AS level
FROM employees;

-- Task 18.1: IIF on commission_pct
